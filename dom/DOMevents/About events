EVENT:- An event is an action that happens in the browser, such as a button being clicked, a key being pressed etc.....


* When an event occurs, you can create an event handler which is a piece of code that will execute to respond to that event.


  if any event occurs to handle that event. eventHandler is required.
  before that eventHandling we need to listen that event is occured or not.for that we need a eventListener.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Events can be assigned to elements via inline event handlers, event handler properties & event listeners.

  There are three ways to assign event handlers.

  1) HTML event Handler(inline event handlers)
  2) DOM Level event handlers
            =>by using event handler properties.
            =>by using eventListeners.
